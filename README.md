# Power-Bi
Developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize e-commerce sales data, aiming to provide insights into sales performance and product trends to drive strategic decision making and optimize revenue generation.
I have taken this dataset from kaggle. Used different functions and features such as power query, data modeling, time intelligence functions(TOTALYTD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, etc) and dax queries. 
Designed and developed interactive dashboards in Power BI. Create dynamic visualizations such as kpi, bar charts, donut charts and map chart to find actionable insights and opportunities for revenue growth.
